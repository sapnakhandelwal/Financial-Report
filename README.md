Dataset Link- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/sample-financial-download

I did sales and profit analysis of Financial Data across different segments, products and countires for Year 2013-2014.
I make my dashboard interactive by using slider for Date and writing DAX function.
Also you can select specific information of any month of Year 2013 or Year 2014 by clicking on dropdown menu.
